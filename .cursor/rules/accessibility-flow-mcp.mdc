# Accessibility: Default to flow-mcp

For any accessibility-related question or request in this project, **use the flow-mcp MCP server by default**.

## When the user asks about accessibility

1. **Urgent / top issues**  
   Call `getMostUrgentIssues` first to list the most urgent accessibility issues (with severity, WCAG level, criteria, occurrences). Offer to run `getIssueRemediation` for any issue they want to fix.

2. **Fixing a specific issue**  
   Use `getIssueRemediation` with the issue’s `displayName` (e.g. `Link-Context-105301f082`) to get step-by-step remediation. Apply fixes only if the user explicitly asks to fix.

3. **After resolving an issue**  
   Use `resolveIssue` with the issue’s `displayName` when the user has fixed it and wants it marked resolved in accessFlow.

4. **Feedback**  
   When the MCP response includes a feedback prompt, include that feedback section at the end of your reply.

## Flow-mcp tools to use

- `getMostUrgentIssues` – list most urgent issues (default for “accessibility issues”, “urgent a11y”, etc.)
- `getIssueRemediation` – detailed fix guidance for one issue
- `resolveIssue` – mark an issue as resolved
- `submitFeedback` – send feedback when the user responds to the feedback prompt

Do not fix issues unless the user explicitly asks to fix them. Prefer surfacing data and remediation first, then fixing when requested.
